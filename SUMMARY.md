**Pesteh Dataset** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 423 images with 3929 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pistachio*).

Images in the Pesteh dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 pistachios categories: ***open*** (1995 objects) and ***close*** (1934 objects). The dataset was released in 2021 by the University of Science and Technology, Iran and Sharif University of Technology, Iran.
